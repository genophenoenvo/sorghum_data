# sorghum_data

<Fill in cleaning procedures that are the same for all files.>

File name:

season_phenotype_filter_pvalue_

Example file name for files exported from the VCF filtering process:

season6_maxgrowth_growthrateQTLmaxgrowthGWAS_0001

season6_maxheight_canopyheightGWAS_0001

Each "run" will have one VCF file and a zipped archive with all of the distance matrices for each SNP left after the filtering process is done.

Each "run" will be processed separately against the variation in max growth rate and max height data to identify SNPs with variation that mimic the variation of the phenotype of concern.
